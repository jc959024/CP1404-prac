# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were not always accurate at the beginning. I tended to underestimate how long it would take to debug or properly configure Flask, especially when running into issues like import errors or missing packages.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I worked on more practicals and encountered recurring problems (e.g., missing templates, incorrect file names, GitHub linking), I became more realistic in my time estimates. I also became better at anticipating setup time and test/debug cycles.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating programming tasks is a skill that improves with experience. I now consider potential problems, like debugging or refactoring, as part of my estimation process instead of just coding time.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learned to be more mindful of code readability and structure. Sometimes others pointed out things I thought were clear but were not to them, which helped me improve my naming and organization.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me reflect on my own coding habits. I could spot better ways to structure Flask routes, write comments, or improve variable names by reading someone elseâ€™s work objectively.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Review on Flask Basic Project](https://github.com/jc959024/CP1404-prac/tree/main/prac_10/flaskProject)

### Explanation

In this review, I provided suggestions on using `render_template` for better maintainability instead of returning raw HTML strings. I also pointed out a variable naming inconsistency and suggested reusing a temperature conversion function.

### Good Code Review 2

[Review on Flask + Wiki Project](https://github.com/jc959024/flaskdemo)

### Explanation

I reviewed the handling of disambiguation and page errors in the Wikipedia search route. I also recommended using Jinja template blocks correctly to avoid HTML repetition and make the layout cleaner.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would include a clearer explanation of how to distinguish between local files and external libraries when using `import`, especially when students accidentally install third-party libraries with the same name as their files (like `temperature`). I would also include a tutorial on uploading projects to GitHub for beginners.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I persisted through debugging and solved multiple issues including Flask import errors, local module conflicts, and how to integrate Wikipedia API with route templates. I also created a well-structured Flask project with clean navigation and reusable templates, and I successfully pushed it to GitHub with meaningful commit messages.
